GENKI-R2009a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2009a release of the GENKI data set contains 7172 unique image files, which
combine to form two subsets: 

-GENKI-4K: 4000 images, containing expression and head-pose labels.
-GENKI-SZSL: 3500 images, containing face position and size labels.

Each image file has a unique name. Each subset consists of an "Images" text file
and a "Labels" text file. The Images file has one image name per line. The
corresponding line in the Labels file contains the data label for that file.

Specific type and meaning of each label is documented in each subset's "README"
file.
